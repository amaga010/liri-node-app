# My Liri Bot 

### Welcome !

I've created a LIRI app.  LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

It's very simlple to use ! All you need is a basic understanding of terminal usage. 

### What it Does

The liri app allows you to search for an artist, movie, or song; and will give you information based on a specific paramater

### How it Works

Simply type in your request into the the appropriate parameter and watch as LIRI fetches your data.

There are three types of possible parameters:

1. The Concert LIRI

      formated: `node liri.js concert-this "<artist/band name here>"`
      
      This LIRI command returns a venue name and location, as well as a concert date for the given artitst/band
      
2. The Spotify LIRI

      formated: `node liri.js spotify-this-song "<song name here>"`
      
      This LIRI command returns the artist(s), the song's name, a preview link of the song from Spotify, and the album that the song is from
      
3. The Movie LIRI

      formated `node liri.js movie-this "<movie name here>"`
      
      This LIRI commans returns title of the movie, year the movie came out, IMDB Rating of the movie, Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie, country where the movie was produced, language of the movie, plot of the movie, and actors in the movie
